description: How to configure your MacBook if you're developer or advanced user
---

After what feels like ages (seriously, sorry for the wait), we’re back with Part 2 of this epic guide to crafting a professional macOS configuration. This time, we’re diving into the must-have system and developer tools. Let’s geek out!

## Table of contents

## Terminal application

For developers, the terminal is a second home—where projects come to life (and occasionally crash spectacularly). Sure, macOS comes with Terminal.app, but why settle for good when you can have great? Here’s a list of power-packed alternatives to level up your terminal game:

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- [alacritty](https://alacritty.org)
- [warp](https://app.warp.dev/referral/7G54Y6)
- [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com)
- [wave](https://www.waveterm.dev)
- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
- [tabby](https://tabby.sh)
- [hyper](https://hyper.is/)
- [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)

I’m partial to Warp and iTerm2, but every option here has its perks. Currently, Warp has my heart—it’s sleek, ridiculously fast, and fully customizable (with just a bit of elbow grease).

### Warp configuration

First things first—choose a theme. Head over to Settings > Appearance > Themes and pick your favorite. I swear by the [snazzy](https://github.com/GrimLink/warp-theme-snazzy/). If you’re using iTerm2, grab [snazzy for iTerm](https://github.com/sindresorhus/iterm2-snazzy) too. Matchy-matchy is cool, right?

Single-Line Prompt? Yes, please.
Warp now supports a single-line prompt—finally! (Check out this blog [post](https://www.warp.dev/blog/why-it-took-us-11-months-to-move-a-single-line-of-text) for a behind-the-scenes look at why this “simple” feature took months to implement.)

![Warp](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/warp-01.png)

To fully enjoy modern shell themes (like the upcoming powerlevel10k), set the font to `MesloLGS NF`. Don’t worry, this font will be installed automatically later.

![Warp](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/warp-02.png)

Another useful thing is to dim inactive panes and to follow the cursor. If you have a tab which is diveded to several panes (this can be done via `cmd+d` to split right or `cmd+shift+d` to split down) - just move your cursor over the pane to make it active.

![Warp](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/warp-03.png)

About splitting panes - I'd like to recommend to you the following configuration. In most cases you do splitting to perform something useful in the same directory, but opening f the new tabs and windows in most cases is related to another project or activity.

![Warp](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/warp-04.png)

If you like to enter commands from the top of the screen - there is an option for that.

![Warp](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/warp-05.png)

It is useful to have similar keyboard shortcuts in different applications and, fortunately most of the terminals have similar shortcuts. One little tweak - set `cmd+r` to clear screen.

![Warp](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/warp-06.png)

### iTerm2 configuration

Time to pimp out iTerm2. First of all, let's check that you've enabled the warning before quit option.

![iTerm](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/iterm-01.png)

Then let's configure tabs. Now - tab bar is visible even if there is only one tab open or iterm2 is in full screen mode.

![iTerm](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/iterm-02.png)

Similar to Warp, we will set `MesloLGS NF` font for our terminal.

![iTerm](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/iterm-03.png)

Sometimes it may be required to scroll back to find some text in logs, so we will enable unlimited scrollback.

![iTerm](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/iterm-04.png)

And, similar to Warp, we will enable the follow-cursor feature for split panes.

![iTerm](@/data/images/macos-sequoia/iterm-05.png)

## Package manager

Say hello to [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), the package manager that makes installing, updating, and managing software a breeze. Get started with

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once installed, you can do cool things like:

```bash
brew install firefox
```

and uninstall (with cleanup)

```bash
brew uninstall google-chrome --zap
```

`--zap` key is used to remove associated configuration files from the system. Also, you can search required apps [here](https://formulae.brew.sh) or using command prompt

```bash
brew search firefox
```

and get package info using

```bash
brew info firefox
```

To supercharge your setup, create a Brewfile. It’s a one-stop list of all your favorite tools and apps. `Brewfile` may contain following lines

- `tap` is used to fetch information from external package repos
- `brew` is used to install command line utils
- `cask` is used to install apps with graphical interface
- `mas` is used to download and install apps from Mac AppStore

Here’s a quick sample:

## Shell and shell prompt

Then, lets setup our shell. I do prefer [zsh](https://zsh.org), but you may choose something else, like [fish shell](https://fishshell.com) or any other shell.

Let's improve our zsh experience with [Oh My Zsh (OMZ)](https://ohmyz.sh) framework, which contains color themes, plugins and other useful stuff:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Another good alternative is a [starship](https://starship.rs/) shell prompt, but unfortunately we cannot use two or more beautiful shells in one console :)

OMZ installer will create `.zshrc` file with default OMZ settings.

Next, let's install [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme:

```bash
brew install powerlevel10k
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/share/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme" >>~/.zshrc
```

or using git

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

On the first run it will download all required fonts and ask you to choose look for your shell

![powerlevel10k](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/master/configuration-wizard.gif)

Later, you can change your configuration with following command

```bash
p10k configure
```

Let's fine-tune our `.zshrc` file. Here's mine with comments:

```zsh

```

## Chezmoi

[Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) allows you to backup/restore and sync your dotfiles across all your devices. It works fine with `topgrade`, so every time you update all your packages - you'll update your dotfiles.

I think you've installed Chezmoi with Homebrew, but if not - there's an [instruction](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/) for that.

After installation, you need to initialize chezmoi using

```bash
chezmoi init
```

Now you can add your dotfiles using

```bash
chezmoi add ~/.zshrc
```

When you've finished adding files, you need to visit chezmoi directory `~/.local/share/chezmoi` with

```bash
chezmoi cd
```

and put all files under git.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Then you need to create git repository with your GitHub or GitLab account and push your changes

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

After that, you can return to your working directory with

```bash
exit
```

## GPG

Last thing I'd like to tell you about is a GPG, GNU Pretty Good Privacy tool. You can use it to sign your commits and emails, encrypt and decrypt data.

> WARNING: DO NOT PUT YOU `.gnupg` DIRECTORY UNDER CHEZMOI TO AVOID SECURITY ISSUES!!!

Firstly, we need to create our first private key

```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

You'll be asked for your name and email

```text
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.6; Copyright (C) 2024 g10 Code GmbH
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

gpg: directory '/Users/alec/.gnupg' created
Note: Use "gpg --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation dialog.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Alexey Poimtsev
Email address: alec@alec-c4.com
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Alexey Poimtsev <alec@alec-c4.com>"

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit?
```

and after that - for secure passphrase to protect your key.

To view your keys, you can use the following command

```bash
gpg --list-keys
```

You'll see something like

```text
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: next trustdb check due at 2027-11-30
[keyboxd]
---------
pub   ed25519 2024-11-30 [SC] [expires: 2027-11-30]
      57CFFC30D9C385EB637A9A17117803DB62CCA5D1
uid           [ultimate] Alexey Poimtsev <alec@alec-c4.com>
sub   cv25519 2024-11-30 [E] [expires: 2027-11-30]
```

To export your secret key (e.g. for backup) we need to do the following:

1. Find your secret key id

```bash
$ gpg --list-secret-keys
[keyboxd]
---------
sec   ed25519 2024-11-30 [SC] [expires: 2027-11-30]
      0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
uid           [ultimate] Alexey Poimtsev <alec@alec-c4.com>
ssb   cv25519 2024-11-30 [E] [expires: 2027-11-30]
```

Where `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` is your secret key id.

2. Export key to the file

```bash
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 > ~/my-priv-gpg-key.asc
```

3. Store your key to secure space

Later, to restore your key you can use following command

```bash
gpg --import ~/my-priv-gpg-key.asc
```

## Sign git commits with GPG

The last step is to configure your git client to sign git commits using GPG. Earlier we've installed `pinentry-mac` program using homebrew, let's add it to GPG config

```bash
echo "pinentry-program $(brew --prefix)/bin/pinentry-mac" > ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
```

To ensure that changes were applied, let's restart GPG agent using

```bash
killall gpg-agent
```

Remember, earlier we saw our key `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. We need to export our public key to add it to GitHub or any other platform.

```bash
gpg --armor --export 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

You'll see something like

```text
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
00000
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

You can upload this public key to GitHub [here](https://github.com/settings/keys).

Configure git to use GPG with our key to sign all commits

```bash
git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg)
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global user.signingkey 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

and let's check how its work

```bash
git commit -S -s -m "My Signed Commit" --allow-empty
```

Finally, your `~/.gitconfig` will look like

```plaitext
[filter "lfs"]
	clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
	smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
	process = git-lfs filter-process
	required = true
[user]
	name = Alexey Poimtsev
	email = alec@alec-c4.com
	signingkey = 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
[init]
	defaultBranch = master
[pull]
	rebase = true
[alias]
	cgl = config --global --list
	l = log --graph --pretty='%Cred%h%Creset -%C(auto)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%ad) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --date=short
[commit]
	gpgsign = true
[gpg "ssh"]
	allowedsignersfile = /Users/alec/.ssh/allowed_signers
	program = /Applications/1Password.app/Contents/MacOS/op-ssh-sign
[gpg]
	program = /opt/homebrew/bin/gpg
```

## Useful hacks

### Expired GPG key

You can easily renew your key

```bash
gpg --edit-key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

then

```text
gpg> expire
(follow prompts)
gpg> save
```

or simply

```bash
gpg --quick-set-expire 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 1y
```

where `1y` is amount of years. There are some other options:

<n> - amount of days
<n>w - amount of weeks
<n>m - amount of months
<n>y - amount of years

### Send keys to public keyservers

```bash
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-keys 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-keys 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Then you can find your keys https://pgp.mit.edu
