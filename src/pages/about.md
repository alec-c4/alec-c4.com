I'm Alexey Poimtsev ‚Äî technical director, entrepreneur, and software development expert. A passionate geek, as well as a loving father and husband, I started this blog to share my experience in engineering, product management, and business.

With years of hands-on coding, leading teams, and building products from the ground up, I‚Äôve learned both the technical and strategic sides of software development. Here, I share insights, lessons learned, and practical advice for developers, tech leaders, and founders navigating the ever-changing world of technology. I hope you find it insightful and valuable!
