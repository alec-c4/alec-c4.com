A modular, role-based AI coding environment designed for building modern **Ruby on Rails (8.0+)** applications using **Claude Code**.

This repository transforms a generic AI coding assistant into a specialized **Rails Engineering Team** that lives in your terminal.

## 🌟 Features

- **Autonomous Team:** The Orchestrator (`/dev`) can dynamically adopt roles (Architect, Developer, Auditor) to solve complex tasks end-to-end.
- **Native Integration:** Uses Claude's native Slash Commands (`/arch`, `/code`) for seamless interaction.
- **Modern Stack:** Rails 8.0, Hotwire, Inertia.js, GraphQL, Solid Queue/Cache, Kamal.
- **Quality First:** Strict TDD workflows, Security Audits (Brakeman), and "Definition of Done".
- **Production Ready:** Built-in support for i18n, Feature Flags, and MCP tools (AppSignal, GitHub).
